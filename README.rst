Bitwig Studio on Flatpak
========================
Just me trying to make this thing work on Flatpak; which rules.

Instructions
============
* Install flatpak
* Install jack (doesn't work; working on it)
* Setup flathub (for dependencies): https://flatpak.org/setup/
* Install development tools: https://www.ostechnix.com/install-development-tools-linux/
* Use the make file to build and install: ``make``. You can use <tab> <tab> to check out what is available. Also, you can check the
  Makefile to see what it does.

Help me!

Help me improve this:
* write better instructions
* fix the jack problem
* better flatpack file
